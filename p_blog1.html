      <h2>Ethical Issues of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Healthcare</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>AI applications in healthcare have literally changed the medical field, including imaging and electronic medical records (EMR), laboratory diagnosis, treatment, augmenting the intelligence of the physicians, new drug discovery, providing preventive and precision medicine, biological extensive data analysis, speeding up processes, data storage and access for health organizations. However, this field of science faces various ethical and legal challenges.</p>
      
      <h3>Privacy and Data Protection</h3>
      <p>In healthcare, current laws are not enough to protect an individual’s health data. Clinical data collected by robots can be hacked into and used for malicious purposes that minimize privacy and security. Some social networks gather and store large amounts of users’ data, for instance, individuals’ mental health data, without their consent, which can be helpful in the marketing, advertising, and sales of these companies.</p>
      
      <h3>Social Gaps and Justice</h3>
      <p>Another problem that threatens societies following the development of AI is the social gap issue. In all countries around the world, with every development, discovery and invention, people face greater social inequality and less social justice. Automation and advanced economies have widened the gap between developing and advanced countries. Many people lose their jobs as robots grow and develop. Bookkeepers and managers in different communities could lose their jobs with the increase of automated systems, and there will be a considerable decrease in salaries.</p>
